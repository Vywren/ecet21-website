    <h4>Importance of Drives and Controllers</h4>
  </a>

  <p>When it comes to powering a motor, there are more steps involved than just directly connecting the motor to a power
    supply. In our physical motor demonstration, you will see that each of the three motors has a motor driver to
    accompany it. The purpose of the motor drive is to regulate the amount of power going into each motor. By doing so,
    we can then directly control the speed of each of our motors. Without the driver, a motor would just operate
    continuously based on the amount of power coming from its power supply. </p>
  <p> A motor driver only handles managing the power going into a motor, whereas a motor controller can manage multiple
    aspects of the motor. These aspects can include starting and stopping, rotation, speed, torque, and even protection
    against circuit faults. These aspects of control will vary depending on the type of motor and controller you are
    using. In our physical setup, it includes both the use of motor drives and a motor controller. For more information
    on either motor drivers or motor controllers, refer to the links below: </p>

  <a id="l2"></a>
  <h4>Servo motors</h4>
  <p>A servo motor operates by using a radially magnetized rotor to achieve precision control. They operate using a
    stator, field windings that produce a magnetic field, and a rotating rotor. Servo motors can be either AC or DC,
    where AC servo motors are more suited to higher currents and DC motors are more suited for smaller applications.
    There are three common types of servo motors, positional rotation, continuous rotation, and linear. A positional
    rotation servo motor can only rotate between 180 degrees, limiting its range of motion. A continuous rotation servo
    contains no limit on its range of motion, allowing the motor to freely rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. A
    linear motion servo motor converts rotational motion into linear motion through the use of a rack and pinion
    mechanism to change its output. Typically, servo motors will have some sort of sensor, like an encoder, to give
    feedback to its controller about the shaft’s output. The use of a sensor minimizes the error the motor can have.
  </p>
  <p> Servo motors are used in applications that require high-precision operation at high speeds. Common features in
    servo motors include angular position, acceleration, and velocity control, as well as having high-speed torque (they
    offer good torque at high speeds). Some examples that include servo motors are CNC machines, packaging machines,
    textile processing, and cameras. </p>

    <h4>Induction Motors</h4>
  </a>
  <p> AC induction motors operate under the basic principle of converting electric power into mechanical power. Through
    the use of alternating current (AC), an induction motor is propelled by a rotating magnetic field. There are two
    basic components in any induction motor, the rotor and the stator. The stator is the outer chamber that does not
    move. It is a ring of electromagnets used to produce a rotating magnetic field. Inside the stator, the wire coils
    form magnet poles. When alternating current flows through them, this creates the rotating magnet field. The rotor,
    which also has electromagnets arranged around it, spins inside of the stator by being attracted to the produced
    rotating magnetic field. Therefore, the magnetic field produced by the stator induces a magnetic field in the rotor.
    The rotor is connected to the shaft, which is the external part of the motor we see. As the rotor spins, the shaft
    spins and produces torque. </p>
  <p>
    These motors can be either single-phase (low electricity requirement) or three-phase (high electricity requirement).
    They are typically used in applications where you need a constant rotation to power something. Some examples include
    using induction motors to operate conveyors, fans, pumps, compressors, mixers, and drilling machines.

    <h4>Stepper motors</h4>
  </a>
  <p>A stepper motor operates by rotating in steps that are at a fixed angle. The three components of a stepper motor
    are the stator, the stator windings, and the rotor. The stator is the outermost portion of the motor that doesn’t
    move. It’s connected to the stator windings, which are each wrapped in wire coils. Organizing the coils into certain
    groups will create phases. For example, in the image provided, this is a stepper motor with six windings and has
    three phases. Each of these phases will produce a different magnetic field when powered. When a certain phase is
    active, the rotor will rotate to align itself with the magnetic field produced by that phase. As seen in the image,
    the motor starts at phase A, then switches to phase B, and then phase C before it repeats which phase it switches
    to. Each rotation is one step. By switching between each phase in a sequential order, the rotor can rotate in as
    many steps as desired.</p>
  <p>Due to a stepper motor rotating in fixed steps, it can have very precise movements. This is why stepper motors are
    used in applications that require high-precision motion control. Common features in stepper motors include
    positioning control, speed control, and low-speed torque (they offer good torque at low speeds). Some examples that
    include stepper motors are robotics, 3-D printing, packing, and automation equipment. </p>
