    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p> Connected Components Workbench is a program that allows us to control our motors and drives. It comes with a large amount of tools that will help with any motor related project. In this lab, we will go over how to install Connected Components Workbench</p>
    <h3> Procedure </h3>
    <ol>
    <li class = "reset-style"><p> To start with, go to the Rockefeller automation page for Connected Components workshop. You can find it on google or click the link <a href = "https://compatibility.rockwellautomation.com/Pages/MultiProductFindDownloads.aspx?crumb=112&refSoft=1&toggleState=&versions=57681" target = "_blank">Here</a>
    </p></li>
    <img src = "install1.png" alt = "Image of download page" title = "Download Page" width="560" height="315"> <br/>
    <br\>
    <li class = "reset-style"> <p>
    Click the dropdown and select all versions, then pick the latest version. Then check the box that says select files. If you have not signed in to a Rockefeller account, it wil then prompt you to sign in. If you do not have an account, complete the steps under register and repeat the earlier steps. You should arrive at a page that looks like this
    </p></li> 
    <br\>
    <img src = "install2.png" alt = "Image of download selection" title = "Download Checklist" width="560" height="315"> <br/>
    <li class = "reset-style"><p>
    For our purposes we will only need to check the top box, "Connected Components Workbench Standard Multiple Languages Edition". However, feel free to try out any of the add-ons. When you finish checking your add-ons click the shopping cart button on the top right. On the next page click download now and agree to the terms and conditions. If your download has not started click the button that says direct download and click all of the links that appear.    
    </p></li>
    <br\>
    <li class = "reset-style"><p>Now open the application file that you just downloaded and wait. If you downloaded the files directly skip this step. </p></li>
    <br\>
    <li class = "reset-style"><p>Open the application called "22.00.00-CCW-INT-Std-DVD.part1.exe". If you didn't change the install folder it will be in a folder labeled "RA". Opening it will extract to the "RA" folder by default</p></li>
    <br\>
    <img src = "install3.png" alt = "RA folder in File explorer" title = "RA folder in File explorer" width="560" height="315"> <br/>
    <li class = "reset-style"><p>Running the "22.00.00-CCW-INT-Std-DVD.part1.exe" application will create a folder called "22.00.00-CCW-INT-Std-DVD". inside of this folder you will find an application called "common install". Run this applicatation and follow the instructions. You will need administrator privileges. You may run into an issue where you do not have .net Framework 3.5 installed, which is a requisite for this program to run. You may be able to remedy this by opening "windows features" in control panel and checking .net Framework 3.5 before pressing ok. Then follow the instructions that pop up</p></li>
