    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p> What they can expect to learn by completing the experiment (objectives). Provides them with any extra
        information they need to know before going into the experiment. </p>
    <h3> Procedure </h3>
    <p>List of steps they should follow - what we want them to do/find at each step. Would ideally include images of
        some steps to help them understand better what they are supposed to be doing.
    </p>
    <h3> Intended Results</h3>
    <p> This section will contain what information, data, and so-on they should have gathered at each step in the
        experiment. That way they can check their answers to ensure they completed the experiment correctly. </p>
    <h3> Summary </h3>
    <p>A brief summary of what they did and what they should have learned. Also will include anything else we should
        mention about the motor in relation to the physical system. </p>
